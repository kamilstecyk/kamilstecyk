- Stone Wholesaler with QR Codes ( HTML + CSS + JS + PHP + MySQL ) Private project in private repo [code here](https://github.com/kamilstecyk/inventory_project) :eyes:

Short description: :speech_balloon:

In the application it is possible to add stocks and track them, such as stone blocks, slabs or gravestones. After adding, a QR code is generated that can be printed and labeled. Thanks to this code, anyone can scan the item to see details such as net price, gross price, type of stone, etc. , which is displayed on a special website. The application owner also has the ability to prepare products for purchases thanks to code scans and generate summaries based on them. The application makes it much easier to run a wholesaler
